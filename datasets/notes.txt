Notes:

* current dataset is in 5 min chunks open -> close.
* close does not match open of next 5 min chuck. viz will not match... expect this (note for outliers).
* will probably fuck up predictions (adjust confidence intervals)

* format of api parser: data['Time Series (5min)']['2018-10-29 14:10:00']['1. open']
* code can only run in 5 min chucks if using this data set (is there other datasets?)
